# Employee Turnover Prediction

## Introduction
This project aims to predict employee turnover using machine learning techniques. It provides a solution for organizations to identify employees who are likely to leave the company, allowing proactive measures to be taken for employee retention.

## Data
The project utilizes a dataset containing various attributes of employees, such as age, job role, salary, satisfaction level, and performance evaluations. The dataset includes both the historical turnover data and the features associated with employees.

## Methods Used
The project employs a combination of exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning algorithms to build a predictive model for employee turnover. The following steps are performed:

1. Data preprocessing and cleaning
2. Exploratory data analysis to gain insights
3. Feature engineering to extract relevant features
4. Model selection and training
5. Model evaluation and performance analysis

## Technologies
The project is implemented using the following technologies:

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Google Colab

The machine learning libraries used include:

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
